# Final-Examination-API-2023
The Algorithms and Data Structures project requires designing and coding a C program from a natural language description. The goal is to apply knowledge from the Algorithms and Computer Science Principles course to create an efficient and correct implementation.
## Execution
1. Extract the open tests from *open_test_archive.zip* into the executable folder.
2. Open the terminal (CMD) at the executable folder location and type:

   `Project.exe < open_"number".txt > "filename".txt`

   Or in PowerShell:

   `cmd /c 'Project.exe < open_"number".txt > "filename".txt'`

   This way, the program will write the result to the *"filename".txt* file.

3. Using various tools, it is possible to compare the *"filename".txt* file with the *open_"number".output.txt* file extracted from *open_test_archive.zip*.
